# LCE-Steampunk

Modrinth page is [here](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/steampunk-texture-pack-lce) (most likely will not be updated to the latest version until it is considered stable enough to push)

Partial Java port of the Steampunk Texture Pack. This pack is an old Legacy Console resource pack, updated to the latest versions by the Legacy4J group.

Compatible with Legacy4J itself (and Re-Console).
